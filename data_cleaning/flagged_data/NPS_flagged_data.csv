LACL_tlikr_stream_sediment,0,366,2016,BM decided to exclude this site in the script.  The description in AKOATS is that it is installed sub-surface in the sediment near upwelling.  It is the only site in the the available dataset of this description and thus not comparable to all the other ~100 sites in this dataset.
